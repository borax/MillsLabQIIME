Code used by the Mills lab for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis

9/19/16 - The current version of the pipeline used swarm OTU picking and chimera checking.  Data should be 250 PE Illumina sequencing reads of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.  We currently use 8 bp barcodes. Separate batch files parallelize steps that can be run in parallel.
